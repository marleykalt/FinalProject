Through meaningful hands-on experiences, the children in these two classrooms gained deep understandings of themselves and their surroundings, made personal connections and developed empathy as they heard stories of children around the world. In their learning journey, the two teachers used thinking routines to help the children slow down and observe the world around them.

According to epigenetics research, toxic stress has the capacity to physically change a child\u2019s brain and be hardwired into the child\u2019s biology via genes in the DNA. The compelling nature of the impact of early adversity on later health and development has generated interest in protection against the impact of early adversity. Research highlights three interrelated \u201ccore protective systems\u201d associated with positive adaptation. Early childhood educators are in a unique position to play a role in early identification of ACEs and to contribute to the development of protective skills. Adults within the early childhood education community can assist in increasing physical health and mental well-being for children who have encountered ACEs. Safe and healthy environments that allow the child to play, explore, and maximize his/her capacities are examples of how individual protective factors can be enhanced. Early childhood educators can support the child\u2019s protective system by building the child\u2019s personal attributes associated with resiliency, such as self-efficacy and self-regulation. Early childhood educators can provide a secure relationship, which is especially critical for children who have experienced trauma because it can provide extra support in times of stress. Additionally, by working collaboratively with parents, early childhood educators provide an additional layer of protection for children who experience adversity. Lastly, at the community level, early childhood educators can bring awareness to the public and private sectors by informing others of ACEs effect on early brain development and the link to later outcomes on individuals and society.

To date, the research exploring the link between honors participation and college grades and retention has obtained mixed results; some of the seemingly conflicting findings may stem from the presence of methodological limitations, including the difficulty with adequately accounting for selection into honors programs. In addition, virtually no research has explored the conditions under which honors programs are most strongly related to desired outcomes. To provide a rigorous examination of the potential impact of this experience, this study conducted propensity score analyses with a large, multi-institutional, longitudinal sample of undergraduates at 4-year institutions. In the full sample, honors participation predicts greater college GPA and 4-year graduation, while it is unrelated to college satisfaction and retention. However, these results differ notably by institutional selectivity: Honors participation is associated with greater college GPA, retention to the third and fourth years of college, and 4-year graduation at less selective institutions, but it is significantly related only to GPA at more selective institutions.

We test the hypothesis that the salient financial burden of college impairs students\u2019 cognitive functioning, especially when it creates an identity conflict or perceived barrier to reaching a student\u2019s desired financially successful future. First, we use longitudinal data from 28 selective colleges and universities to establish that students who accumulate student loan debt within these contexts are less likely to graduate from college because student loan debt predicts a decline in grades over time, even when controlling for factors related to socioeconomic status and prior achievement. Then, in an experiment, we advance research in this area with a direct, causal test of the proposed psychological process. An experimental manipulation that brings high college costs to mind impairs students\u2019 cognitive functioning, but only when those thoughts create an identity conflict or a perceived barrier to reaching a student\u2019s desired financially successful future."}, {"identifier": "doi:10.1007/s11162-017-9470-2", "url": [{"format": "html", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11162-017-9470-2"}, {"format": "pdf", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11162-017-9470-2"}, {"format": "", "platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11162-017-9470-2"}], "title": "Beyond Traditional Measures of STEM Success: Long-Term Predictors of Social Agency and Conducting Research for Social Change", "creators": [{"creator": "Garibay, Juan C."}], "publicationName": "Research in Higher Education", "issn": "0361-0365", "eissn": "1573-188X", "openaccess": "false", "journalid": "11162", "doi": "10.1007/s11162-017-9470-2", "publisher": "Springer", "publicationDate": "2018-05-01", "onlineDate": "2017-08-08", "coverDate": "2018-05", "printDate": "2018-04-05", "volume": "59", "number": "3", "issuetype": "Regular", "topicalCollection": "", "startingPage": "349", "endingPage": "381", "copyright": "\u00a92017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "abstract": "AbstractDespite the importance of preparing socially responsible graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to address the current state of poverty and inequality, very few studies in higher education have examined the development of STEM students\u2019 outcomes critical to promoting a more equitable society, typically focusing on the impact of one program or course.

However, no significant incremental effect associated with unsubsidized loan aid, net of subsidized loan aid, could be detected.

Because envisioned educational aims have significant consequences for how educational practices, pedagogy, and curricula are conceptualized, the failure to acknowledge and embrace differences in ability leaves open the question of the extent to which students with intellectual disabilities are subject to the same aims as their \u201ctypically-developing\u201d peers. In articulating and defending valued aims of education, educational philosophers tacitly or expressly concede that particular aims will be ill suited to many children with intellectual disabilities, and that separate aims will therefore apply to them. This paper evaluates the philosophical reasoning behind this conclusion that some people, by necessity, must be governed by separate educational aims, to be decided separately and secondarily. The author calls this the \u201cdeferral stance.\u201d First, the paper outlines concerns about a particular ability-biased social and epistemic context in which theorizing about educational aims takes place. The author then examines assumptions that underpin the logic of deferral, arguing that the logic proves flawed when subjected to conceptual and empirical scrutiny.

Young children experiencing autism spectrum disorder are being diagnosed at a young age and they are commonly receiving their education within inclusive early childhood settings. This article presents two methods to meet the needs of children with autism spectrum disorder. First, early childhood educators can provide interventions tailored to the children\u2019s learning needs. Second, educators can adapt the environment, materials, activity, instruction, and assistance they provide so that each child is appropriately supported, while still being encouraged to succeed as independently as possible. This article summarizes research-based interventions and adaptations that early childhood educators can implement within inclusive settings to meet the diverse needs of young children with autism spectrum disorder and presents a case study to describe how these practices can support young children with autism spectrum disorder within inclusive settings."}, {"identifier": "doi:10.1007/s10643-017-0861-y", "url": [{"format": "html", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10643-017-0861-y"}, {"format": "pdf", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10643-017-0861-y"}, {"format": "", "platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10643-017-0861-y"}], "title": "An Evaluation of Videomodeling on Fundamental Motor Skill Performance of Preschool Children", "creators": [{"creator": "Obrusnikova, Iva"}, {"creator": "Cavalier, Albert"}], "publicationName": "Early Childhood Education Journal", "issn": "1082-3301", "eissn": "1573-1707", "openaccess": "false", "journalid": "10643", "doi": "10.1007/s10643-017-0861-y", "publisher": "Springer", "publicationDate": "2018-05-01", "onlineDate": "2017-05-02", "coverDate": "2018-05", "printDate": "2018-03-21", "volume": "46", "number": "3", "issuetype": "Regular", "topicalCollection": "", "startingPage": "287", "endingPage": "299", "copyright": "\u00a92017 Springer Science+Business Media New York", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "abstract": "AbstractProficiency in fundamental motor skills (FMS) is important for both the health and the overall growth and development of young children. To identify factors that facilitate the development of FMS, the study provided preliminary data on the effect of videomodeling (VM) on the acquisition of FMS by typically developing young children. Participants were six conveniently selected typically developing preschool-age children from an early care and education center. A multiple-baseline-across-participants single-subject research design was used to evaluate VM effects. Motor skill acquisition was assessed with validated developmental sequences of the standing long jump and the overarm throw. The results demonstrated that the VM intervention improved participants\u2019 FMS performance and the improvement was maintained even after the withdrawal of the VM, 2\u00a0weeks after the last VM session. Qualitative data collected via a self-report enjoyment scale and field notes with the instructors elicited four factors that might have affected participants\u2019 performance: their attention and motivation to perform the task and the skill complexity and reproduction. The data suggest that VM may be an efficient strategy for teaching FMS to preschool-age children."}, {"identifier": "doi:10.1007/s10643-017-0857-7", "url": [{"format": "html", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10643-017-0857-7"}, {"format": "pdf", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10643-017-0857-7"}, {"format": "", "platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10643-017-0857-7"}], "title": "Information and Digital Literacies in a Kindergarten Classroom: An I-LEARN Case Study", "creators": [{"creator": "Tecce DeCarlo, Mary Jean"}, {"creator": "Grant, Allen"}, {"creator": "Lee, Vera J."}, {"creator": "Neuman, Delia"}], "publicationName": "Early Childhood Education Journal", "issn": "1082-3301", "eissn": "1573-1707", "openaccess": "false", "journalid": "10643", "doi": "10.1007/s10643-017-0857-7", "publisher": "Springer", "publicationDate": "2018-05-01", "onlineDate": "2017-04-18", "coverDate": "2018-05", "printDate": "2018-03-21", "volume": "46", "number": "3", "issuetype": "Regular", "topicalCollection": "", "startingPage": "265", "endingPage": "275", "copyright": "\u00a92017 Springer Science+Business Media New York", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "abstract": "AbstractThis case study, part of a larger qualitative research project, involved 24 kindergarteners and their teacher in the design, development, and evaluation of a research project built around the I-LEARN model (Neuman, Learning in information-rich environments: I-LEARN and the construction of knowledge in the 21st Century.

associations between children\u2019s skills in recognizing emotional expressions and their problem behaviors. Few studies have examined these associations over time, however, precluding our understanding of the direction of effects. Emotion recognition difficulties may contribute to the development of problem behaviors; additionally, problem behaviors may constrain the development of emotion recognition skill. The present study tested the bidirectional linkages between children\u2019s emotion recognition and teacher-reported problem behaviors in 1st and 3rd grade. Specifically, emotion recognition, hyperactivity, internalizing behaviors, and externalizing behaviors were assessed in 117 children in 1st grade and in 3rd grade. Results from fully cross-lagged path models revealed divergent developmental patterns: Controlling for concurrent levels of problem behaviors and first-grade receptive language skills, lower emotion recognition in 1st grade significantly predicted greater internalizing behaviors, but not hyperactivity or externalizing behaviors, in 3rd grade. Moreover, greater hyperactivity in 1st grade marginally predicted lower emotion recognition in 3rd grade, but internalizing and externalizing behaviors were not predictive of emotion recognition over time. Together, these findings extend previous research to identify specific developmental pathways, whereby emotion recognition difficulties contribute to the development of internalizing behaviors, and early hyperactivity may contribute to the development of emotion recognition difficulties, thus highlighting the importance of examining these processes and their mutual development over time."}, {"identifier": "doi:10.1007/s10578-017-0764-6", "url": [{"format": "html", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10578-017-0764-6"}, {"format": "pdf", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10578-017-0764-6"}, {"format": "", "platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10578-017-0764-6"}], "title": "Co-Occurring Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Depression Among Young Children", "creators": [{"creator": "Salloum, Alison"}, {"creator": "Johnco, Carly"}, {"creator": "Smyth, Kristin M."}, {"creator": "Murphy, Tanya K."}, {"creator": "Storch, Eric A."}], "publicationName": "Child Psychiatry & Human Development", "issn": "0009-398X", "eissn": "1573-3327", "openaccess": "false", "journalid": "10578", "doi": "10.1007/s10578-017-0764-6", "publisher": "Springer", "publicationDate": "2018-06-01", "onlineDate": "2017-10-19", "coverDate": "2018-06", "printDate": "2018-03-26", "volume": "49", "number": "3", "issuetype": "Regular", "topicalCollection": "", "startingPage": "452", "endingPage": "459", "copyright": "\u00a92017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "abstract": "AbstractThe purpose of this study was to examine differences in: (1) mental health emotional and behavioral problems between young children experiencing PTSD with and without MDD; (2) the incidence of caregiver PTSD and MDD between children with PTSD\u2009\u00b1\u2009MDD; and (3) the number of traumatic events and interpersonal versus non-interpersonal nature of trauma events among children whose parents sought child trauma-focused treatment.

The data were drawn from the Pitt Mother & Child Project, a sample of 310 low-income, ethnically diverse boys. Drawing on tenets of both attachment and social learning theory, it was hypothesized that coercive mother\u2013son interaction would lead to reductions in positive maternal parenting in the toddler period, and that both positive parenting and mother\u2013son coercion in the toddler period would contribute to children\u2019s conduct problems at school entry and lower social skills and peer rejection in middle childhood. The results were largely confirmed, such that mother\u2013son coercive interaction at 18 months was related to decreases in positive parenting at 24 months. Additionally, mother\u2013son coercive interaction and positive parenting at 24 months were linked to child conduct problems at age 5, which in turn predicted child social skills and peer rejection during middle childhood. In addition to indirect effects through child conduct problems, mother\u2013son coercion continued to be independently related to school-age peer rejection.

Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) to help youth who are transitioning out of foster care to achieve self-sufficiency through an array of independent living services. Although states are required to report CFCIP service provision to the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), the degree of heterogeneity of the aging out population from the service receipt perspective and state implementation is unknown. The CFCIP calls for a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns of services receipt to prepare for youth\u2019s successful transition to adulthood. Based on the population of 68,057 first-time youth who received CFCIP services in FY2011-FY2013 from the NYTD, we used multi-level latent class analysis (MLCA) to identify underlying combinations of service receipt that may be influenced by youth-level and state-level characteristics. We identified the most preferred model based on interpretability, fit statistics, and split-half replication. The optimal model was a three-class, MLCA solution characterized by a high-service receipt profile, an independent living assessment and academic support receipt profile, and a limited service receipt profile. Among male and female youth, age, education level, and whether states serve youth aged 18 or above were significant characteristics associated with LCA profile membership. States could benefit from understanding existing service receipt patterns and gaps to optimize decisions on service delivery in order to meet youth needs and to identify specific services that may prepare youth aging out of foster care towards positive outcomes."}, {"identifier": "doi:10.1007/s10508-018-1172-0", "url": [{"format": "html", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10508-018-1172-0"}, {"format": "pdf", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10508-018-1172-0"}, {"format": "", "platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-018-1172-0"}], "title": "Gender Variance and Sexual Orientation Among Male Spirit Mediums in Myanmar", "creators": [{"creator": "Coleman, Eli"}, {"creator": "Allen, Mariette Pathy"}, {"creator": "Ford, Jessie V."}], "publicationName": "Archives of Sexual Behavior", "issn": "0004-0002", "eissn": "1573-2800", "openaccess": "false", "journalid": "10508", "doi": "10.1007/s10508-018-1172-0", "publisher": "Springer", "publicationDate": "2018-05-01", "onlineDate": "2018-03-01", "coverDate": "2018-05", "printDate": "2018-04-09", "volume": "47", "number": "4", "issuetype": "Regular", "topicalCollection": "", "startingPage": "987", "endingPage": "998", "copyright": "\u00a92018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "abstract": "AbstractThis article describes the gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation of male spirit mediums in Myanmar.

The focus of this investigation was specifically on achout (gender variant individuals) who were spirit mediums ( nat kadaw). Semi-structured interviews explored the ways that participants understood their gender identity, gender expression, and sexuality in relation to their work as spirit mediums and broader social life. Myanmar remains quite a homophobic and transphobic culture but is undergoing rapid economic and social change. Therefore, it provides an interesting context to study how safe spaces are produced for sexual/gender minorities amidst broader social change. We find that, through the animistic belief structure, there is a growing space for gender nonconforming people, gender variant, and same-sex-oriented individuals ( achout ) to neutralize their stigmatized status and attain a level of respect and economic advantage. Their ability to become nat kadaw (mediums of spirits) mitigates or trumps their stigmatized status."}, {"identifier": "doi:10.1007/s10964-017-0798-x", "url": [{"format": "html", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10964-017-0798-x"}, {"format": "pdf", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10964-017-0798-x"}, {"format": "", "platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10964-017-0798-x"}], "title": "Appraisal Support from Natural Mentors, Self-worth, and Psychological Distress: Examining the Experiences of Underrepresented Students Transitioning Through College", "creators": [{"creator": "Hurd, Noelle M."}, {"creator": "Albright, Jamie"}, {"creator": "Wittrup, Audrey"}, {"creator": "Negrete, Andrea"}, {"creator": "Billingsley, Janelle"}], "publicationName": "Journal of Youth and Adolescence", "issn": "0047-2891", "eissn": "1573-6601", "openaccess": "false", "journalid": "10964", "doi": "10.1007/s10964-017-0798-x", "publisher": "Springer", "publicationDate": "2018-05-01", "onlineDate": "2017-12-27", "coverDate": "2018-05", "printDate": "2018-03-30", "volume": "47", "number": "5", "issuetype": "Regular", "topicalCollection": "", "startingPage": "1100", "endingPage": "1112", "copyright": "\u00a92017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "abstract": "AbstractThe current study explored whether cumulative appraisal support from as many as five natural mentors (i.e., nonparental adults from youth\u2019s pre-existing social networks who serve a mentoring role in youth\u2019s lives) led to reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety via improved global self-worth among underrepresented college students.

The technique utilizes a miniaturized microextraction capsule (MEC) as the extraction medium. The MEC consists of two conjoined porous tubular polypropylene membranes, one of which encapsulates the sorbent through sol-gel technology, while the other encapsulates a magnetic metal rod. As such, MEC integrates both the extraction and stirring mechanisms into a single device. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the application potential of CPME as sample preparation technique for the extraction of a group of personal care products (PCPs) from water matrices. Among the different sol-gel sorbent materials (UCON^\u00ae, poly(caprolactone-dimethylsiloxane-caprolactone) (PCAP-DMS-CAP) and Carbowax 20M (CW-20M)) evaluated, CW-20M MEC demonstrated the best extraction performance for the selected PCPs. The extraction conditions for sol-gel CW-20M MEC were optimized, including sample pH, stirring speed, addition of salt, extraction time, sample volume, liquid desorption solvent, and time. Under the optimal conditions, sol-gel CW-20M MEC provided recoveries, ranging between 47 and 90% for all analytes, except for ethylparaben, which showed a recovery of 26%. The method based on CPME with sol-gel CW-20M followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated for the extraction of PCPs from river water and effluent wastewater samples.

To help ensure the reliable performance of these assays, we are developing a certified reference material (CRM) for calibrating human genomic DNA working standards. To enable sharing information over time and place, CRMs must provide accurate and stable values that are metrologically traceable to a common reference. We have shown that droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) limiting dilution end-point measurements of the concentration of DNA copies per volume of sample can be traceably linked to the International System of Units (SI). Unlike values assigned using conventional relationships between ultraviolet absorbance and DNA mass concentration, entity-based ddPCR measurements are expected to be stable over time. However, the forensic community expects DNA quantity to be stated in terms of mass concentration rather than entity concentration. The transformation can be accomplished given SI-traceable values and uncertainties for the number of nucleotide bases per human haploid genome equivalent (HHGE) and the average molar mass of a nucleotide monomer in the DNA polymer. This report presents the considerations required to establish the metrological traceability of ddPCR-based mass concentration estimates of human nuclear DNA.

Some d -amino acids are metabolized by d -amino acid oxidase (DAO), while d -Asp and d -Glu are metabolized by d -aspartate oxidase (DDO). In this study, levels of 22 amino acids and the enantiomeric compositions of the 19 chiral proteogenic entities have been determined in the whole brain of wild-type ddY mice (ddY/DAO^+/+), mutant mice lacking DAO activity (ddY/DAO^\u2212/\u2212), and the heterozygous mice (ddY/DAO^+/\u2212) using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). No significant differences were observed for l -amino acid levels among the three strains except for l -Trp which was markedly elevated in the DAO^+/\u2212 and DAO^\u2212/\u2212 mice. The question arises as to whether this is an unknown effect of DAO inactivity. The three highest levels of l -amino acids were l -Glu, l -Asp, and l -Gln in all the three strains. The lowest l -amino acid level was l -Cys in ddY/DAO^+/\u2212 and ddY/DAO^\u2212/\u2212 mice, while l -Trp showed the lowest level in ddY/DAO^+/+mice. The highest concentration of d -amino acid was found to be d -Ser, which also had the highest % d value (~\u200925%). d -Glu had the lowest % d value (~\u20090.01%) in all the three strains.

Laser-cut inserts with a layer of electrospun fibers are used as a scaffold for 3D cell culture, with the inserts being easily assembled in a 3D-printed fluidic device for flow-based studies. With this approach, the number and types of cells (on the inserts) in one fluidic device can be customized. Moreover, after an investigation (i.e., stimulation) under flowing conditions, the cell-laden inserts can be removed easily for subsequent studies including imaging and cell lysis. In this paper, we first discuss the fabrication of the device and characterization of the fibrous inserts. Two device designs containing two (channel width\u2009=\u2009260\u00a0\u03bcm) and four (channel width\u2009=\u2009180\u00a0\u03bcm) inserts, respectively, were used for different experiments in this study. Cell adhesion on the inserts with flowing media through the device was tested by culturing endothelial cells. Macrophages were cultured and stimulated under different conditions, the results of which indicate that the fibrous scaffolds under flow conditions result in dramatic effects on the amount and kinetics of TNF-\u03b1 production (after LPS stimulation). Finally, we show that the cell module can be integrated with a downstream absorbance detection scheme. Overall, this technology represents a new and versatile way to culture cells in a more in vivo fashion for in vitro studies with online detection modules.

To improve production efficiency under industrially relevant conditions, coordinated expression of multiple genes by manipulating promoter strengths is an efficient approach. It is known that gene expression is highly dependent on the practically used\u00a0environmental conditions and is subject to dynamic changes. Therefore, investigating promoter activities of S. cerevisiae under different culture conditions in different time points, especially under stressful conditions is of great importance.ResultsIn this study, the activities of various promoters in S. cerevisiae under stressful conditions and in the presence of xylose were characterized using yeast enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP) as a reporter. The stresses include toxic levels of acetic acid and furfural, and high temperature, which are related to fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. In addition to investigating eight native promoters, the synthetic hybrid promoter P _ 3xC - TEF1 was also evaluated. The results revealed that P _ TDH3 and the synthetic promoter P _ 3xC - TEF1 showed the highest strengths under almost all the conditions. Importantly, these two promoters also exhibited high stabilities throughout the cultivation. However, the strengths of P _ ADH1 and P _ PGK1 , which are generally regarded as \u2018constitutive\u2019 promoters, decreased significantly under certain conditions, suggesting that cautions should be taken to use such constitutive promoters to drive gene expression under stressful conditions. Interestingly, P _ HSP12 and P _ HSP26 were able to response to both high temperature and acetic acid stress. Moreover, P _ HSP12 also led to moderate yEGFP expression when xylose was used as the sole carbon source, indicating that this promoter could be used for inducing proper gene expression for xylose utilization.ConclusionThe results here revealed dynamic changes of promoter activities in S. cerevisiae throughout batch fermentation in the presence of inhibitors as well as using xylose. These results provide insights in selection of promoters to construct S. cerevisiae strains for efficient bioproduction under practical conditions. Our results also encouraged applications of synthetic promoters with high stability for yeast strain development."}, {"identifier": "doi:10.1007/s11244-018-0918-1", "url": [{"format": "html", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11244-018-0918-1"}, {"format": "pdf", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11244-018-0918-1"}, {"format": "", "platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11244-018-0918-1"}], "title": "Iodine Activation of Alcohols: A Computational Study", "creators": [{"creator": "Borosky, Gabriela L."}, {"creator": "Stavber, Stojan"}, {"creator": "Laali, Kenneth K."}], "publicationName": "Topics in Catalysis", "issn": "1022-5528", "eissn": "1572-9028", "openaccess": "false", "journalid": "11244", "doi": "10.1007/s11244-018-0918-1", "publisher": "Springer", "publicationDate": "2018-04-09", "onlineDate": "2018-04-09", "coverDate": "", "printDate": "", "volume": "", "number": "", "issuetype": "", "topicalCollection": "", "startingPage": "1", "endingPage": "7", "copyright": "\u00a92018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "abstract": "AbstractA DFT study aimed at unravelling the origin of catalytic activity of iodine in reaction with alcohols is presented.

Moreover, mutations in c TnT are causative in a number of familial cardiomyopathies. With the increasing use of large animal (swine) model to recapitulate human diseases, it is essential to characterize species-dependent protein sequence variants, alternative RNA splicing, and post-translational modifications (PTMs), but challenges remain due to the incomplete database and lack of validation of the predicted splicing isoforms. Herein, we integrated top-down mass spectrometry (MS) with online liquid chromatography (LC) and immunoaffinity purification to comprehensively characterize miniature swine c TnT proteoforms, including those arising from alternative RNA splicing and PTMs. A total of seven alternative splicing isoforms of c TnT were identified by LC/MS from swine left ventricular tissue, with each isoform containing un-phosphorylated and mono-phosphorylated proteoforms. The phosphorylation site was localized to Ser1 for the mono-phosphorylated proteoforms of c TnT1, 3, 4, and 6 by online MS/MS combining collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD). Offline MS/MS on Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer with CAD and electron capture dissociation (ECD) was then utilized to achieve deep sequencing of mono-phosphorylated c TnT1 (35.2\u00a0kDa) with a high sequence coverage of 87%.

Using infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) action spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT), the structures of the [Os,C,2H]^+ and [Os,C,2D]^+ products are explored. This study complements previous work on the related species formed by dehydrogenation of methane by four other 5d transition metal cations (M^+ = Ta^+, W^+, Ir^+, and Pt^+). Osmium cations are formed in a laser ablation source, react with methane pulsed into a reaction channel downstream, and the resulting products spectroscopically characterized through photofragmentation using the Free-Electron Laser for IntraCavity Experiments (FELICE) in the 300\u20131800\u00a0cm^\u22121 range. Photofragmentation was monitored by the loss of H_2/D_2. Comparison of the experimental spectra and DFT calculated spectra leads to identification of the ground state carbyne hydride, HOsCH^+ (^2A\u2032) as the species formed, as previously postulated theoretically. Further, a full description of the systematic spectroscopic shifts observed for deuterium labeling of these complexes, some of the smallest systems to be studied using IRMPD action spectroscopy, is achieved. A full rotational contour analysis explains the observed linewidths as well as the observation of doublet structures in several bands, consistent with previous observations for HIrCH^+ (^2A\u2032).

The co-cultivation model ( Tetraselmis striata and Pelagibaca bermudensis ) was evaluated for the robust biofuel production under varying stressors as well as with the selected two-stage cultivation modes. In addition, the role of metabolic exudates including the quorum-sensing precursors was assessed.ResultsThe co-cultivation model innovated in this study supported the biomass production of T. striata in a saline/marine medium at a broad range of pH, salinity, and temperature/light conditions, as well as nutrient limitation with a growth promotion of 1.2\u20133.6-fold. Hence, this developed model could contribute to abiotic stress mitigation of T. striata . The quorum-sensing precursor dynamics of the growth promoting bacteria P. bermudensis exhibited unique pattern under varying stressors as revealed through targeted metabolomics (using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry, LC\u2013MS). P. bermudensis and its metabolic exudates mutually promoted the growth of T. striata , which elevated the lipid productivity. Interestingly, hydroxy alkyl quinolones independently showed growth inhibition of T. striata on elevated concentration. Among two-stage cultivation modes (low pH, elevated salinity, and nitrate limitation), specifically, nitrate limitation induced a 1.5 times higher lipid content (30\u201331%) than control in both axenic and co-cultivated conditions.ConclusionPelagibaca bermudensis is established as a potential growth promoting native phycospheric bacteria for robust biomass generation of T. striata in varying environment, and two-stage cultivation using nitrate limitation strategically maximized the biofuel precursors for both axenic and co-cultivation conditions (T and T-PB, respectively).

These applications rely heavily on the predictability of hybridization through Watson\u2013Crick base pairing to allow positioning on a nanometer scale, as well as binding to the target transcripts, but also off-target binding to transcripts with partial homology. These effects are of particular importance in the development of therapeutic oligonucleotides, where off-target effects caused by the binding of mismatched sequences need to be avoided.ResultsWe employ a novel method of probing DNA hybridization using optically active DNA-stabilized silver clusters (Ag-DNA) to measure binding efficiencies through a change in fluorescence intensity. In this way we can determine their location-specific sensitivity to individual mismatches in the sequence. The results reveal a strong dependence of the hybridization on the location of the mismatch, whereby mismatches close to the edges and center show a relatively minor impact. In parallel, we propose a simple model for calculating the annealing ratios of mismatched DNA sequences, which supports our experimental results.ConclusionThe primary result shown in this work is a demonstration of a novel technique to measure DNA hybridization using fluorescent Ag-DNA. With this technique, we investigated the effect of mismatches on the hybridization efficiency, and found a significant dependence on the location of individual mismatches. These effects are strongly influenced by the length of the used oligonucleotides. The novel probe method based on fluorescent Ag-DNA functions as a reliable tool in measuring this behavior. As a secondary result, we formulated a simple model that is consistent with the experimental data."}], "facets": [{"name": "subject", "values": [{"value": "Chemistry", "count": "37346"}, {"value":

Both methods are designed to solve the spatial-temporal pseudo-spectral collocation formulations of the GB equation using the deferred correction methods in one time marching step, where the Fourier series based pseudo-spectral formulation is applied in the spatial direction. The main idea is to iteratively apply a low order method to solve an error equation and refine the provisional solutions until they converge to the high order pseudo-spectral solutions both in space and time. In the first method, an operator splitting approach is introduced as the low order preconditioner in the deferred correction procedure for the temporal Gauss collocation formulation of the original GB equation. The method shows good numerical properties when the deferred correction procedure is convergent and the accuracy requirement is achievable. However, due to the stiffness of the linear differential operators, the Krylov deferred correction (KDC) method has to be applied in order to make the iterations converge. And also, due to the spectral differentiation operator involved, the condition number of the algorithm scales as $$O(N^4)$$ O ( N 4 ) , where N is the number of Fourier terms in the spatial direction. To improve the numerical stability and efficiency, an integral equation approach is applied to \u201cprecondition\u201d the GB equation in the second proposed numerical method, by inverting the linear terms of the GB equation analytically.

Two key properties for non-conforming methods to be applicable to real world applications are conservation and energy stability. The summation-by-parts (SBP) property, which certain finite-difference and discontinuous Galerkin methods have, finds success for the numerical approximation of hyperbolic conservation laws, because the proofs of energy stability and conservation can discretely mimic the continuous analysis of partial differential equations. In addition, SBP methods can be developed with high-order accuracy, which is useful for simulations that contain multiple spatial and temporal scales. However, existing non-conforming SBP schemes result in a reduction of the overall degree of the scheme, which leads to a reduction in the order of the solution error. This loss of degree is due to the particular interface coupling through a simultaneous-approximation-term (SAT). We present in this work a novel class of SBP\u2013SAT operators that maintain conservation, energy stability, and have no loss of the degree of the scheme for non-conforming approximations. The new degree preserving discretizations require an ansatz that the norm matrix of the SBP operator is of a degree $$\\ge 2p$$ \u2265 2 p , in contrast to, for example, existing finite difference SBP operators, where the norm matrix is $$2p-1$$ 2 p - 1 accurate.

In this paper, we propose a generalized symmetric ADMM (GS-ADMM), which updates the Lagrange multiplier twice with suitable stepsizes, to solve the multi-block separable convex programming. This GS-ADMM partitions the data into two group variables so that one group consists of p block variables while the other has q block variables, where $$p \\ge 1$$ p \u2265 1 and $$q \\ge 1$$ q \u2265 1 are two integers. The two grouped variables are updated in a Gauss\u2013Seidel scheme, while the variables within each group are updated in a Jacobi scheme, which would make it very attractive for a big data setting. By adding proper proximal terms to the subproblems, we specify the domain of the stepsizes to guarantee that GS-ADMM is globally convergent with a worst-case $${\\mathcal {O}}(1/t)$$ O ( 1 / t ) ergodic convergence rate. It turns out that our convergence domain of the stepsizes is significantly larger than other convergence domains in the literature. Hence, the GS-ADMM is more flexible and attractive on choosing and using larger stepsizes of the dual variable.

In this paper, we propose a primal\u2013dual BCU method for solving linearly constrained convex program with multi-block variables. The method is an accelerated version of a primal\u2013dual algorithm proposed by the authors, which applies randomization in selecting block variables to update and establishes an O (1\u00a0/\u00a0 t ) convergence rate under convexity assumption. We show that the rate can be accelerated to $$O(1/t^2)$$ O ( 1 / t 2 ) if the objective is strongly convex. In addition, if one block variable is independent of the others in the objective, we then show that the algorithm can be modified to achieve a linear rate of convergence. The numerical experiments show that the accelerated method performs stably with a single set of parameters while the original method needs to tune the parameters for different datasets in order to achieve a comparable level of performance."}, {"identifier": "doi:10.1007/s10589-017-9973-y", "url": [{"format": "html", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10589-017-9973-y"}, {"format": "pdf", "platform": "web", "value": "http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10589-017-9973-y"}, {"format": "", "platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10589-017-9973-y"}], "title": "Real eigenvalues of nonsymmetric tensors", "creators": [{"creator": "Nie, Jiawang"}, {"creator": "Zhang, Xinzhen"}], "publicationName": "Computational Optimization and Applications", "issn": "0926-6003", "eissn": "1573-2894", "openaccess": "false", "journalid": "10589", "doi": "10.1007/s10589-017-9973-y", "publisher": "Springer", "publicationDate": "2018-05-01", "onlineDate": "2017-12-04", "coverDate": "2018-05", "printDate": "2018-03-27", "volume": "70", "number": "1", "issuetype": "Regular", "topicalCollection": "", "startingPage": "1", "endingPage": "32", "copyright": "\u00a92017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "abstract": "AbstractThis paper discusses the computation of real $$\\mathtt {Z}$$ Z -eigenvalues and $$\\mathtt {H}$$ H -eigenvalues of nonsymmetric tensors.

Because these impacts are challenging to quantify, however, phytoplankton are often approximated as spheres, and when effects of non-sphericity are studied it is usually experimentally or via geometrical approximations. New methods for quantifying phytoplankton size and shape generally, so all phytoplankton are analyzable by the same procedure, can complement advances in microscopic imagery and automated classification to study the influence of shape in phytoplankton. Here we apply to phytoplankton a technique for defining the size of arbitrary shapes based on the Laplacian\u2014the operator that governs processes, such as nutrient uptake and fluid flow, where phytoplankton shape is expected to have the greatest effect. Deviations from values given by spherical approximation are a measure of phytoplankton shape and indicate the fitness increases for phytoplankton conferred by their non-spherical shapes. Comparison with surface-to-volume quotients suggests the Laplacian-based metric is insensitive to small-scale features which can increase surface area without affecting key processes, but is otherwise closely related to surface-area-to-volume, demonstrating this metric is a meaningful measure. While our analysis herein is limited to axisymmetric phytoplankton due to relative sparsity of 3D information about other phytoplankton shapes, the definition and method are directly generalizable to 3D shape data, which will in the near future be more readily available."}], "facets": [{"name": "subject", "values": [{"value": "Mathematics", "count": "50108"}, {"value": "Mathematics, general",

parameters in biochemical network models from time series concentration data is a central task in computational systems biology. Under the assumption of well mixed conditions the network dynamics are typically described by the chemical master equation, the Fokker Planck equation, the linear noise approximation or the macroscopic rate equation. The inverse problem of estimating the parameters of the underlying network model can be approached in deterministic and stochastic ways, and available methods often compare individual or mean concentration traces obtained from experiments with theoretical model predictions when maximizing likelihoods, minimizing regularized least squares functionals, approximating posterior distributions or sequentially processing the data. In this article we assume that the biological reaction network can be observed at least partially and repeatedly over time such that sample moments of species molecule numbers for various time points can be calculated from the data. Based on the chemical master equation we furthermore derive closed systems of parameter dependent nonlinear ordinary differential equations that predict the time evolution of the statistical moments. For inferring the reaction rate parameters we suggest to not only compare the sample mean with the theoretical mean prediction but also to take the residual of higher order moments explicitly into account. Cost functions that involve residuals of higher order moments may form landscapes in the parameter space that have more pronounced curvatures at the minimizer and hence may weaken or even overcome parameter sloppiness and uncertainty. As a consequence both deterministic and stochastic parameter inference algorithms may be improved with respect to accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the potential of moment fitting for parameter inference by means of illustrative stochastic biological models from the literature and address topics for future research.\n      "], "title_display": "Moment Fitting for Parameter Inference in Repeatedly and Partially Observed Stochastic Biological Models", "score": 4.248061}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0043001/title", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2012-08-10T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.248061}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0043001/introduction", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2012-08-10T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.248061}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0043001/results_and_discussion", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2012-08-10T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.248061}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0043001/materials_and_methods", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2012-08-10T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.248061}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0043001/supporting_information", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2012-08-10T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.248061}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0067508/title", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2013-07-03T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.248061}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0067508/abstract", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2013-07-03T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.248061}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0067508/references", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2013-07-03T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.248061}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0067508/body", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2013-07-03T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.248061}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0067508/introduction", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2013-07-03T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.248061}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0067508/results_and_discussion", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2013-07-03T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.248061}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0067508/materials_and_methods", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2013-07-03T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.248061}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0067508/supporting_information", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2013-07-03T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.248061}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0067508/conclusions", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2013-07-03T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.248061}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0067508", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2013-07-03T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "author_display": ["Gregory Leibon", "Daniel N.

More recently decomposition odour profiling has been employed in the forensic sciences to generate a profile of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by decomposed remains. The chemical profile of decomposition odour is still being debated with variations in the VOC profile attributed to the sample collection technique, method of chemical analysis, and environment in which decomposition occurred. To date, little consideration has been given to the partitioning of odour between different matrices and the impact this has on developing an accurate VOC profile. The purpose of this research was to investigate the decomposition odour profile surrounding vertebrate carrion to determine how VOCs partition between soil and air. Four pig carcasses (Sus scrofa domesticus L.) were placed on a soil surface to decompose naturally and their odour profile monitored over a period of two months. Corresponding control sites were also monitored to determine the VOC profile of the surrounding environment. Samples were collected from the soil below and the air (headspace) above the decomposed remains using sorbent tubes and analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 249 compounds were identified but only 58 compounds were common to both air and soil samples. This study has demonstrated that soil and air samples produce distinct subsets of VOCs that contribute to the overall decomposition odour. Sample collection from only one matrix will reduce the likelihood of detecting the complete spectrum of VOCs, which further confounds the issue of determining a complete and accurate decomposition odour profile. Confirmation of this profile will enhance the performance of cadaver-detection dogs that are tasked with detecting decomposition odour in both soil and air to locate victim remains.\n"], "title_display": "Decomposition Odour Profiling in the Air and Soil Surrounding Vertebrate Carrion", "score": 3.4971197}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0095107/title", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2014-04-16T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 3.4971197}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0095107/abstract", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2014-04-16T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 3.4971197}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0095107/references", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2014-04-16T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 3.4971197}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0095107/body", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2014-04-16T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 3.4971197}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0095107/introduction", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2014-04-16T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 3.4971197}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0095107/results_and_discussion", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2014-04-16T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 3.4971197}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0095107/materials_and_methods", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2014-04-16T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 3.4971197}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0095107/conclusions", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2014-04-16T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 3.4971197}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0030510/body", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2012-01-23T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 3.48518}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0030510/introduction", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2012-01-23T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 3.48518}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0030510/results_and_discussion", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2012-01-23T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 3.48518}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0030510/materials_and_methods", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2012-01-23T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 3.48518}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0030510", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2012-01-23T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "author_display": ["Mika Ito", "Jan Johansson", "Roger Str\u00f6mberg", "Lennart Nilsson"], "abstract": ["\n        Polymerization of the amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2), a process which requires that the helical structure of A\u03b2 unfolds beforehand, is suspected to cause neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. According to recent experimental studies, stabilization of the A\u03b2 central helix counteracts A\u03b2 polymerization into toxic assemblies. The effects of two ligands (Dec-DETA and Pep1b), which were designed to bind to and stabilize the A\u03b2 central helix, on unfolding of the A\u03b2 central helix were investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. It was quantitatively demonstrated that the stability of the A\u03b2 central helix is increased by both ligands, and more effectively by Pep1b than by Dec-DETA. In addition, it was shown that Dec-DETA forms parallel conformations with \u03b2-strand-like A\u03b2, whereas Pep1b does not and instead tends to bend unwound A\u03b2. The molecular dynamics results correlate well with previous experiments for these ligands, which suggest that the simulation method should be useful in predicting the effectiveness of novel ligands in stabilizing the A\u03b2 central helix. Detailed A\u03b2 structural changes upon loss of helicity in the presence of the ligands are also revealed, which gives further insight into which ligand may lead to which path subsequent to unwinding

The current study examines the role individual differences play in subsecond and suprasecond timing judgments, using the schizoptypy personality scale as a test-case approach for quantifying a broad range of individual differences. In two experiments, 129 (Experiment 1) and 141 (Experiment 2) subjects completed the O-LIFE personality questionnaire prior to performing a modified temporal-bisection task. In the bisection task, subjects responded to two identical instantiations of a luminance grating presented in a 4deg window, 4deg above fixation for 1.5 s (Experiment 1) or 3 s (Experiment 2). Subjects initiated presentation with a button-press, and released the button when they considered the stimulus to be half-way through (750/1500 ms). Subjects were then asked to indicate their \u2018most accurate estimate\u2019 of the two intervals. In this way we measure both performance on the task (a first-order measure) and the subjects\u2019 knowledge of their performance (a second-order measure). In Experiment 1 the effect of grating-drift and feedback on performance was also examined. Experiment 2 focused on the static/no-feedback condition. For the group data, Experiment 1 showed a significant effect of presentation order in the baseline condition (no feedback), which disappeared when feedback was provided. Moving the stimulus had no effect on perceived duration. Experiment 2 showed no effect of stimulus presentation order. This elimination of the subsecond order-effect was at the expense of accuracy, as the mid-point of the suprasecond interval was generally underestimated. Response precision increased as a proportion of total duration, reducing the variance below that predicted by Weber\u2019s law. This result is consistent with a breakdown of the scalar properties of time perception in the early suprasecond range. All subjects showed good insight into their own performance, though that insight did not necessarily correlate with the veridical bisection point. In terms of personality, we found evidence of significant differences in performance along the Unusual Experiences subscale, of most theoretical interest here, in the subsecond condition only. There was also significant correlation with Impulsive Nonconformity and Cognitive Disorganisation in the sub- and suprasecond conditions, respectively. Overall, these data support a partial dissociation of timing mechanisms at very short and slightly longer intervals. Further, these results suggest that perception is not the only critical mitigator of confidence in temporal experience, since individuals can effectively compensate for differences in perception at the level of metacognition in early suprasecond time. Though there are individual differences in performance, these are perhaps less than expected from previous reports and indicate an effective timing mechanism dealing with brief durations independent of the influence of significant personality trait differences.\n"], "title_display": "Individual differences in first- and second-order temporal judgment", "score": 4.9146295}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0164029/title", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2016-11-09T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.88681}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0164029/abstract", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2016-11-09T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.88681}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0164029/references", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2016-11-09T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.88681}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0164029/body", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2016-11-09T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.88681}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0164029/introduction", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2016-11-09T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.88681}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0164029/results_and_discussion", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2016-11-09T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.88681}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0178899", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2017-06-05T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "author_display": ["Ines Schindler", "Georg Hosoya", "Winfried Menninghaus", "Ursula Beermann", "Valentin Wagner", "Michael Eid", "Klaus R.

Therefore, the empirical study of these experiences requires conceptualization and measurement of aesthetic emotions. Despite the long-standing interest in such emotions, we still lack an assessment tool to capture the broad range of emotions that occur in response to the perceived aesthetic appeal of stimuli. Elicitors of aesthetic emotions are not limited to the arts in the strict sense, but extend to design, built environments, and nature. In this article, we describe the development of a questionnaire that is applicable across many of these domains: the Aesthetic Emotions Scale (Aesthemos). Drawing on theoretical accounts of aesthetic emotions and an extensive review of extant measures of aesthetic emotions within specific domains such as music, literature, film, painting, advertisements, design, and architecture, we propose a framework for studying aesthetic emotions. The Aesthemos, which is based on this framework, contains 21 subscales with two items each, that are designed to assess the emotional signature of responses to stimuli\u2019s perceived aesthetic appeal in a highly differentiated manner. These scales cover prototypical aesthetic emotions (e.g., the feeling of beauty, being moved, fascination, and awe), epistemic emotions (e.g., interest and insight), and emotions indicative of amusement (humor and joy). In addition, the Aesthemos subscales capture both the activating (energy and vitality) and the calming (relaxation) effects of aesthetic experiences, as well as negative emotions that may contribute to aesthetic displeasure (e.g., the feeling of ugliness, boredom, and confusion).\n"], "title_display": "Measuring aesthetic emotions: A review of the literature and a new assessment tool", "score": 4.88681}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0178899/title", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2017-06-05T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.88681}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0178899/abstract", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2017-06-05T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 4.88681}]}}, "http://api.plos.org/searchapi_key-fzeeJCRRxtN872QjXEnT_q-subject:Education_rows-25_wt-json": {"response": {"numFound": 32269, "start": 0, "maxScore": 7.6585526, "docs": [{"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0184231/body", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2017-08-29T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Correction", "score": 7.6585526}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0184231/supporting_information", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2017-08-29T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Correction", "score": 7.6585526}, {"id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0184231", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "eissn": "1932-6203", "publication_date": "2017-08-29T00:00:00Z", "article_type": "Correction", "author_display": ["Arnhild Myhr", "Monica Lillefjell", "Geir Arild Espnes", "Thomas Halvorsen"], "abstract": [""], "title_display": "Correction: Do family and neighbourhood matter in secondary school completion?

Methods: Nationwide cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. A total of 86,116 CHS visitors selected from 35 cities were interviewed. Descriptive analysis and multinomial logistic regression analysis were employed to analyze characteristics of CHS users, frequency of CHS utilization, and the socio-demographic and socio-economic factors influencing frequency of CHS utilization. Results: Female and senior CHS clients were more likely to make 3\u20135 and \u22656 CHS visits (as opposed to 1\u20132 visits) than male and young clients, respectively. CHS clients with higher education were less frequent users than individuals with primary education or less in 2008 and 2009; in later surveys, CHS clients with higher education were the more frequent users. The association between frequent CHS visits and family income has changed significantly between 2008 and 2011. In 2011, income status did not have a discernible effect on the likelihood of making \u22656 CHS visits, and it only had a slight effect on making 3\u20135 CHS visits. Conclusion: CHS may play an important role in providing primary health care to meet the demands of vulnerable populations in China. Over time, individuals with higher education are increasingly likely to make frequent CHS visits than individuals with primary school education or below. The gap in frequency of CHS utilization among different economic income groups decreased from 2008 to 2011.

We aim to investigate patient satisfaction with this policy and its influencing factors in Shenzhen. Methods: 3,848 patients visiting eight CHS centers in Shenzhen of China between May 1 and July 28, 2013 were recruited. We interviewed them using a structured questionnaire to investigate their satisfaction with the gatekeeper policy of CHS. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify influencing factors. Results: Of the respondents, 28.17%, 47.27% and 24.56% were satisfied with, neutral to, and not satisfied with the gatekeeper policy respectively. Patient satisfaction with this policy was found to be associated with education level, familiarity with the policy, referral experience, satisfaction with convenience of seeing a doctor, satisfaction with waiting time, satisfaction with medical facility, satisfaction with general medical practitioners\u2019 professional skill, and proportion of expense reimbursed. Conclusions: Our investigation shows that patient satisfaction with the gatekeeper policy was low. To improve patient satisfaction, efforts should be made to increase the convenience of seeing a doctor in community, shorten waiting time, improve general medical practitioners\u2019 professional skill, and increase proportion of expense reimbursement.
